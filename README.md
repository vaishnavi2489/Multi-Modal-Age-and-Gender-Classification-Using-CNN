🧠 Multi-Model Age & Gender Classification with Healthcare and Behavior Predictions

-> A real-time face analysis system that captures a user’s face using a webcam and performs:
1. Age estimation
2. Gender classification
3. Emotion detection
4. Skin type analysis
5. Personalized healthcare and skincare recommendations
6. Built with Python, OpenCV, DeepFace, and NumPy.

 🚀 Features
- 📷 Real-Time Face Capture using webcam
- 🧠 Age Prediction
- 🚻 Gender Classification
- 😊 Emotion Detection
- 🧴 Skin Type Detection (Dry, Oily, Normal, Combination)
- 💡 Personalized Skincare & Health Suggestions.
  
🧠 How It Works
1. Face Capture 
2. Captures webcam feed
3. Detects largest face using OpenCV
4. Shows live video with face bounding box
5. Facial Analysis
6. Uses DeepFace to predict age, gender, emotion
7. Saves temporary image for analysis
8. Skin Type Detection
9. Converts face to HSV
10. Uses brightness and saturation to classify skin type
11. Healthcare & Behavior Recommendations
12. Emotion-based suggestions
13. Age-based advice
14. Skin-type-based skincare guidance
